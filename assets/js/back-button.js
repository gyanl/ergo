 * It means "where I just came from", so it runs the browser's own back — the

 * state, which navigating to the same URL by href would not do.
 *
 * The href is the fallback and the no-JS behaviour both: the markup ships a
 * plain link to the page's parent in the site (see _includes/site/logo.html),
 * and this only takes the click when there is genuinely somewhere to go back
 * to. Someone who arrived from a search engine, a shared link or a new tab has
 * no history to pop, and popping anyway would take them off the site entirely —
 * or, with an empty history, do nothing at all and leave a dead button.

   * document.referrer is what settles that: it is the page that linked here,
