"content": "Date of births . The “Significant Objects” Experiment . Overview . | Experiment: Rob Walker (a journalist) and Joshua Glenn (a writer and editor) conducted an experiment called “Significant Objects.” They bought inexpensive items—often small trinkets or knickknacks—for a total of about $250.   . | Method: They asked over 200 contributing writers to craft short, fictional stories about each object. These stories were then included in the items’ descriptions when put up for auction online.   . | Result: Many of these ordinary items sold for far more than their original price. Collectively, the items purchased for $250 sold for over $8,000. This dramatic markup highlights the power of narrative in shaping consumer perception. | . Why It Matters . | Emotional Connection   | .    - By giving each item a unique backstory—whether humorous, poignant, or mysterious—the project tapped into buyers’ emotions, making them see the objects as more than mere curios. | Illustrates Perceived Value   | .    - The experiment demonstrates that perceived value isn’t just about material worth or brand; it’s also about the story surrounding a product. | Implications for Design and Marketing   | .    - For anyone involved in branding, marketing, or user experience, this provides a case study in how powerful narratives can sway decision-making and willingness to pay. More on “Significant Objects” . | Project Website: Significant Objects   . | Collected Stories: The project eventually compiled many of the fictional backstories into a book, showcasing the effectiveness of storytelling in commerce. | Influence: Marketers, UX designers, and storytellers often cite it as a prime example of how narrative can drive engagement and value. | . Key Takeaway . “Storytelling has a 30X Return on Investment” underscores the idea that a compelling narrative can imbue even mundane things with heightened value, proving that in many fields—especially design—the story you tell can be just as important as the product itself. The Pudding . The Pudding explains ideas debated in culture with visual essays. Some of the most complex, debated topics get lost in “too long; didn’t read” 10,000-word articles. Visual storytelling makes ideas more accessible—or so goes the adage “a picture is worth a thousand words.” . ![[images/pudding.png]] . Nightingale . Nightingale is the journal of the Data Visualization Society (DVS). They feature high-quality articles covering many of the applications of data visualization—including history, sports, how-to, best practices, and many other compelling aspects or implementations of visual information design.

"title": "Levels of Measurement",
"content": "Data Measurement Scales . These scales describe how data can be categorized, ranked, or measured with varying degrees of precision. Below are four common data types—Nominal, Ordinal, Interval, and Ratio—along with examples and references. 1. Nominal . Definition . | Data can only be categorized. | No intrinsic ordering exists between different categories. | . Examples . | City of birth: (Delhi, Ranchi, Kolkata, Mysore) | Gender: (Male, Female) | Car brands: (Hyundai, Toyota, Mercedes) | Marital status: (Unmarried, Married, Divorced) | . 2. Ordinal . Definition . | Data can be categorized and ranked. | The exact difference between rankings is not necessarily equal. | . Examples . | Language ability: (Beginner &amp;lt; Intermediate &amp;lt; Fluent) | Spiciness levels: (Mild &amp;lt; Medium &amp;lt; Hot &amp;lt; Extra Hot) | Medal placements: (Gold &amp;gt; Silver &amp;gt; Bronze) | . 3. Interval . Definition . | Data can be categorized, ranked, and evenly spaced. | No true zero point (0 does not mean an absence of the quantity). | . Examples . | Temperature (Fahrenheit/Celsius): The difference between 10°C and 20°C is the same as between 20°C and 30°C, but 0°C does not mean “no temperature.” | Calendar years: The interval of five years is always the same length, but year 0 doesn’t represent the absence of time. | Time of day: From 1 p.m. to 2 p.m. is the same interval as from 2 p.m. to 3 p.m., but 0:00 hours is just a starting reference, not “no time.” | . 4. Ratio . Definition . | Data can be categorized, ranked, evenly spaced, and has a natural zero point. | Zero means the complete absence of the quantity. | . Examples . | Height: If you have 0 cm of cloth, that is no cloth. | Age | Weight: 10 kg is half of 20 kg. | Temperature in Kelvin: 0 K is absolute zero, meaning no thermal energy. | . Q1 . How could you differentiate interval and ratio data in practical survey scenarios? . Q2 . Are Likert scales and other similiar 5 point rating systems Ordinal or Interval scales? . Q3 .

Dear Data is a year-long, analog data drawing project by Giorgia Lupi and Stefanie Posavec, two award-winning information designers living on different sides of the Atlantic. By collecting and hand drawing their personal data and sending it to each other in the form of postcards, they became friends. What Goes On At 213 . A pocket-book zine showing data visualization through illustration. San Myeong Kim observed people walking past this one door on East 23rd Street and took note of their peculiarities and illustrated them.

Reference   . | The Data Journalism Handbook: https://datajournalism.com/read/handbook | . 3. Explore . Goal: Investigate the data to discover patterns, trends, or questions you didn’t know to ask.   . Techniques:   . | Dashboards: Interactive interfaces showing multiple linked visualizations.   . | Simulations: Models allowing “what-if” analyses or scenario testing.   . | . Example   . | A real-time business intelligence dashboard that alerts users to unusual sales patterns.   | . The Life and Death of Data . Tied in Knots . Reference   . | Ben Shneiderman’s mantra: “Overview first, zoom and filter, then details on demand.” | . 4. Experience . Goal: Reveal deeper meaning or evoke an emotional/intuitive response through creative, immersive, or artistic representations.   . Techniques:   . | Data Art Piece: Artistic installations that transform data into sculpture or visual art.   . | New Media Installation: Interactive exhibits where visitors can engage with data physically or virtually.   . | . Example   . | A museum piece visualizing climate change data as a dynamic art display that changes color over time. | . Data Art . Poppy Field . Following the end of the First World War, the poppy became a symbol of commemoration. It was among the first plants to spring to life on Europe&#39;s devastated battlefields.

Step 1 - Where, who, why? . Think of a map that you would like to make. You can make a map of your hometown, the locality you grew up in, the city you live in now, or something else. Try adding one more angle to this map - is it a map of quiet places in Delhi? What to see in Hyderabad if you&#39;re only there for a day? . Step 2 - Mental Model . Without looking at an actual map, start sketching on pen and paper out what you remember about the area. You can mark out places of interest, roads, even memories that are unique to you. Step 3 - Curate . Now look at the same space on a map of your choice. You may find more things you forgot about, and you&#39;ll have a more accurate real world representation of places and distances. You can take a screenshot and start redrawing your sketch to account for these. Step 4 - Abstract . Try and find a visual metaphor that works for this map. Is there a shape that is forming that you could smoothen to make it more geometric? Are there clear associations for some other shape that you can make with this area? If you can&#39;t find anything else, try and fit things to a square, hexagonal, or other grid. Submission Format .
