**Subject Code:** UCD & UX 1
**Course Title:** Ergonomics: Physical and Cognitive
August to December 2025

**Course Objective:** Understand, apply, identify, design, and integrate ergonomic principles (physical and cognitive) for digital products, minimizing discomfort, cognitive overload, and ensuring accessibility. 

**Semester:** 3rd
### Key Areas Covered:

**Introduction to Ergonomics & Human Factors:** 
Definition of ergonomics, human factors, and human-system interaction; importance in digital product design.

**Physical Ergonomics:** 
Anthropometry, biomechanics, and their application in designing devices, workstations, and physical interfaces; minimizing physical strain and promoting comfort.

**Cognitive Ergonomics:** 
Human perception, attention, memory, mental models, and cognitive load; designing interfaces to reduce mental effort and improve comprehension.

**Interaction Design Laws & Principles:** 
Relevant laws (e.g., Fitts's Law, Hick's Law) and Gestalt principles applied to ergonomic UI design; feedback mechanisms and effective error handling.

**Designing for Diverse Abilities (Accessibility):** 
Principles of inclusive design, WCAG guidelines, and considerations for users with various physical and cognitive impairments.

Sample Assignments

Ergonomics Audit: Conduct a physical and cognitive ergonomics audit of a mobile app feature or a public utility

service (e.g., self-checkout kiosk), identifying issues and proposing improvements.

Phygital Ergonomics Redesign: Analyze a physical-digital interaction (e.g., interactive museum exhibit, smart

home device) and propose a redesign to enhance ergonomic comfort and cognitive flow.

Accessible UI Redesign: Redesign a digital interface (e.g., a public utility service) specifically for users with a

particular vision or motor impairment, justifying design choices based on accessibility guidelines.

# Detailed Structure

#### Introduction
Good and bad design
Form and function
Ergonomics


Why should things be efficient?
- Are we designing for _comfort only_, or for _meaningful interaction_?
- Microwave meal vs home cooked meal

#### Accessibility and inclusive design
Why design accessible interfaces
Different types of accessibility considerations
