title: Exercise - Drawing Chairs
---

### Objective 

- Make anthropometry tangible: see how measurements vary even in a small group.
- Apply the “5th–95th percentile” design rule to a real dataset.
- Visualize how chairs/tables must be adjusted for comfort across body sizes.

### Step 1: Measure (10 min)

Each student pairs up with another and takes **3 body measurements** with a tape measure or phone ruler app:

1. **Popliteal height** (floor to back of knee, sitting) → for seat height.
2. **Buttock–popliteal length** (back of buttock to back of knee, sitting) → for seat depth.
3. **Elbow height (sitting)** (seat to underside of elbow, arm bent at 90°) → for table height.

Record values in a shared Google sheet.


### Step 2: Build the “Class Anthropometry Dataset” (10 min)

- Plot all measurements in a quick table.
- Calculate **min, max, median**.
- Identify **approx. 5th percentile and 95th percentile** (with only 7 students, use the lowest and highest as proxies).


### Step 3: Design Specs (20 min)

As a class, answer:

- What **seat height** would fit most people? (Usually between 5th–95th popliteal height).
- What **seat depth** would avoid cutting off circulation behind knees? (shouldn’t exceed shortest buttock–popliteal).
- What **table height** matches median elbow height?
  
Write down **one chair + one table spec** that fits your class population.

E.g., “Seat height 44cm, depth 42cm, table height 70cm.”


### Step 4: Sketch (10 min)

- Individually: each student draws a few **chairs** on paper that match the chosen class dimensions. It can be a standard classroom chair, ergonomic adjustable chair, a stool, a bench, anything.
    
- Share sketches around. Notice variety in solutions. Discuss: 

### Step 5: Reflection (10 min)

Group discussion:

- What compromises did you have to make?
- Who would this chair be a good chair for?
- Did designing for the “average” leave anyone uncomfortable?
- What does this teach us about **universal design vs. personalization**?

### Submission format

- Submit 3 drawings of chairs in the Google Drive. Try and get the submitted photos as clean as possible.
