This website documents some of the material I shared with students as part of the UCD & UX 1 Course on Ergonomics (Physical and Digital course I taught at JSID/Ecole Intuit Lab in Delhi in Aug 2025.

### Jekyll Garden

This website uses [Jekyll-Garden](https://github.com/Jekyll-Garden/jekyll-garden.github.io), an open source theme for Jekyll created by [Hiran Venugopalan](https://github.com/hfactor)that can be used with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for a public notes solution.
