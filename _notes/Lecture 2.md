## Physical Ergonomics

- Anthropometry

Interpret **percentile data** and apply it to design decisions (e.g., chair heights, smartphone sizes).

The data obtained from anthropometric measurements varies, even within the same population, because each individual has different anatomical body structures. Therefore, we have to calculate anthropometric measurement data into a normal distribution.

Class activity to measure their body measurements, design a table and a chair for a population of just this class. Draw some chairs

3. Recognize how posture, force, and repetition affect comfort and injury risk.

sample diagrams of ergonomic chairs (neutral posture) for comparison.

4. Identify examples of poor vs. good physical ergonomics in everyday devices/workstations.
5. Apply ergonomic principles to propose small design improvements that minimize strain.
