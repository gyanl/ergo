title: Exercise - Ergonomics in the Environment
---

### Objective 

- Make anthropometry tangible: see how measurements vary even in a small group.
- Apply the “5th–95th percentile” design rule to a real dataset.
- Visualize how chairs/tables must be adjusted for comfort across body sizes.

### Instructions
1.  **Find a Poor Design (Outside Class)**
 - Over the next week, look around your environment (home, campus, café, public transport, etc.).       
- Identify **one example** of poor ergonomics — physical _or_ cognitive.
- _Physical_: a chair that causes bad posture, a kiosk too high/low, awkward desk setup.
- _Cognitive_: a cluttered signboard, confusing interface on a ticket machine, inconsistent controls.

2. **Photograph It**
    
    - Take a clear photo of the object or interface in context (avoid people’s faces).
    - Make sure the problematic aspect is visible.
    
3. **Reflect (Short Write-Up, ~250 words)**
    
    - **Description:** What is the object/interface? Where did you find it?
        
    - **Ergonomic Problem:** Why is it poor ergonomics? Who would it be comfortable or uncomfortable for?
        
    - **Impact on Users:** What discomfort, confusion, or errors might result?
        
    - **Proposed Redesign:** Suggest one improvement, with reasoning.

### Submission format

- Create a Google doc with your photos and writeup in the submission Drive folder
